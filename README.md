# Where It Is Intro

This project is inspired by my wife since I always need to ask her "where's my stuff".

"Where It Is" provides a solution for people who struggle with finding things that they aren't using for daily life, e.g. charger, screwdriver, school glue...

When user wants to remember something, simply take a photo(s) or upload an existing picture(s) to  "Where It Is", our APP will recognize what the thing is and where to put it by using google's Vision API.

## Phrases

2. Transfer from Webview to React Native

## How to Make a Vision API request

https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/request


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
